Things learned today:

* Word of the day - mulct : to punish by fine.
	* Ex: The ruler used an income tax primarily to mulct his subjects.
* How to [keep a cuff](http://www.ehow.com/how_5077021_keep-cuff-jeans.html) in jeans.
* Bash command line practice from Coursera - [Part 1](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/startup/lecture_slides%2Flecture4a-linux-command-line.pdf) and [part 2](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/startup/lecture_slides%2Flecture4b-developer-environment.pdf).
* You don't know JS - [This and Object Prototypes](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20&%20object%20prototypes/ch1.md)
	* Many programmers don't fully understand how to use ```this``` and fall back to reliance on lexical scope instead.
<br><br>
{%highlight javascript%}
function foo(num) {
    console.log( "foo: " + num );

    // keep track of how many times `foo` is called
    data.count++;
}

var data = {
    count: 0
};
{%endhighlight%}

* An alternative is to use ```this.count++;``` and to call the function via ```foo.call( foo, i );```, which forces ```this``` to point at the function object.
