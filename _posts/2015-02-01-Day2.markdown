Things learned today:

* From [minimaxir's](http://minimaxir.com/2014/09/buzzscrape/) blog post:
	* [Kimono Labs](https://www.kimonolabs.com/) offers a nice option to make web scraping easier.
	* In the case of BuzzFeed, it was unusable because of a 10-page archive limit. 
	* [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) with [Mechanize](http://wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/) is a more flexible option. ([Guide](http://swizec.com/blog/scraping-with-mechanize-and-beautifulsoup/swizec/5039))
