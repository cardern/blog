Things learned today:

* Not too much to include today. On watches:
	* Need a spring bar tool or a small flathead screwdriver to remove a strap.
	* End pieces are little metal flaps used for a flush finish. They make it hard to remove a spring bar.
	* Never try to undo the middle part of a metal band because you won't get it back together.
* BeautifulSoup: Easy to use, example script to retrieve URLs below.

{%highlight python%}
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

url = raw_input("Enter a website for extraction: ")
r  = requests.get("http://" +url)

data = r.text
soup = BeautifulSoup(data)

for link in soup.find_all('a'):
    print(link.get('href'))
