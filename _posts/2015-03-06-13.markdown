Things learned today:

* Bash guide from startup engineering on [Coursera](https://class.coursera.org/startup-001/wiki/week2)
* The typical place to store custom bash scripts is usr/local/bin. 
* chmod 755 to reserve write access for the user and make executable.
* Script created: [zippy](http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-useful-bash_profile-and-bashrc-tips/answer/Eren-Golge?srid=iSIw&share=1) (to unzip/extract anything). 
* [Auto-complete](http://www.wildboy.co/blog/6-snippets-to-make-terminal-awesome/) sudo and man, colorize ls and grep.
* Benefit of using tmux (or screen) - terminal sessions become persistent until you shut down.
* Karen in Californication - "They're just words - I know you mean them, but I don't know what they mean to you."
* [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes) documentation - supposed to make aligning stuff easier.
* [Clearfix](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/211383/which-method-of-clearfix-is-best?rq=1) for positioning stubborn divs.
* [Percentage heights](http://webdesign.about.com/od/csstutorials/f/set-css-height-100-percent.htm) are tricky to use in CSS. [Vertically aligning](http://phrogz.net/css/vertical-align/index.html) content can also be difficult.
* jQuery Mobile makes working with layout very difficult. Alternative flipswitches [here](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=css+flipswitch&spell=1).
* [Setting and getting cookies](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14573223/set-cookie-and-get-cookie-with-javascript) with javascript.
*Made [something](http://www.colin.im/restaurant/) to help my parents pick somewhere to eat for dinner.
