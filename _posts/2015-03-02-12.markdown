Things learned today:

* More on Powershell from [Microsoft's training course](http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/getting-started-with-powershell-3-0-jump-start):
	* You can use Powershell for remote servers on mobile devices using Powershell Web Application.
	* The reason that you need .\ScriptName to run a script within a directory is to prevent attacks. In the old days of Unix, attackers would create scripts such as "pwd" that would execute when run within a directory.
	* The Powershell community is very strong and helpful. Try asking questions on Powershell.org or on Twitter.
* [Contract templates](http://mashable.com/2014/06/30/free-contract-templates/) for freelancing.
* From [Unix tutorial](http://www.oliverelliott.org/article/computing/tut_unix/):
	* Command substitution allows you to run a command and store the output to a variable or use it as an argument. Syntax: $(command)
	* Process substitution allows a command to appear as a file. Syntax: <(command)
	* Piping to grep allows you to quickly find a certain word or phrase in a file.
	* Awk and sed are good for simple parsing or text manipulation problems. The author only uses sed to replace text or delete lines.
