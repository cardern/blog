Things learned today:

* Word of the day: 
* Good article on [self reflection](https://medium.com/who-what-why/your-past-experiences-are-blinding-you-bd3902b762e6).
* Examples of [interactive development](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9317159&utm_term=comment) in action.
* Advice on [startups](http://www.talkingquickly.co.uk/2015/04/what-id-tell-myself-about-startups). See points [57](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) and 59 for reading suggestions.
* Another Git resource - [Git from the Bottom Up](http://ftp.newartisans.com/pub/git.from.bottom.up.pdf)
* [Tutorial](http://webglfundamentals.org/) to learn about WebGL. One of the biggest downsides right now is lack of mobile support.
