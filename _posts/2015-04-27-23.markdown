Things learned today:

* To recover pictures/data:
	* use dd to make a copy of the disk image. Use a greater block size (bs=1m) to speed up the process, and use [rdiskN](http://codefeed.com/blog/osx-dd-dead-slow). Look at the activity monitor to see transfer speeds.
	* Use [PhotoRec](http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec) to recover the photos. 
	* Other options are [ZAR](http://www.z-a-recovery.com/download.aspx)(Windows),[TestDisk](http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk), [Recuva](https://www.piriform.com/recuva).
* To embed a background HTML5 video, use [video.js](http://www.videojs.com/).
* Consider using [wow.js](http://mynameismatthieu.com/WOW) for DOM animations in the future.
* [Me, my, I'm](https://medium.com/@bydanielvictor/the-one-word-reporters-should-add-to-twitter-searches-that-you-probably-haven-t-considered-fadab1bc34e8) are all great words to use in tracking down sources on Twitter based on recent events.
* When [traveling alone](https://medium.com/@alexschiff/how-and-why-to-travel-alone-595e980714e6), use [Hostelworld](http://www.hostelworld.com/) for reviews, stay ~3 nights per city, don't plan more than a few days in advance in specifics, read the news of the country that you are in.
