Things learned today:

* Word of the day: 
* [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) helps to make different browsers render content more consistently.
* [Three.js](http://threejs.org/docs/#Manual/Introduction/Creating_a_scene) is a library for making cool 3D stuff in browser with WebGL.
* Visualizing your [git repository](http://think-like-a-git.net/sections/graphs-and-git/visualizing-your-git-repository.html).
* Managing [multiple deploy environments](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:1LQ-B2U3DgsJ:indelible.io/blog/2013/07/26/jekyll-deploy-script.html&hl=en&gl=us&strip=1) using Github Pages, useful for maintaining dev and prod.
	* For personal site, in prod: ```git remote add dev ../dev```
	* To update prod: ```git pull dev master```
* When using Sass, you can have it watch a specific file: ```sass --watch input.scss:output.css``` or a directory: ```sass --watch dev/sass:dev/css```
* There is a [theme park](https://vimeo.com/76694540) in Italy made mostly by one man.
