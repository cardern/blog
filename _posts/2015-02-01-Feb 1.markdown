Welcome to my new blog inspired by [John](http://john.do/today/). It is a collection of things I learn each day for personal use.

Things Learned Today:

- How to create a blog with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) and how to host said blog on GitHub Pages.
  - Needed to create a new repo, install jekyll there, and create a new branch (gh-pages).
  - Will need to both build and commit (to correct branch) with each post.
  - Unordered lists need a space after the bullet point in markdown.
- How to use Build System in Sublime Text, configured with Chrome to replace View in Browser.
- From [patio11](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2015/01/28/design-and-implementation-of-csvexcel-upload-for-saas/):
  - [SheetJS](http://sheetjs.com/) is a pretty cool way to make .csv imports easy.
  - [GenerateData](http://www.generatedata.com/) can be used to generate random datasets easily.
  - OSS projects should have commercial license fees instead of donations.
